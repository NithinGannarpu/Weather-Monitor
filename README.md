#Weather-Monitoring-System

Weather monitoring station or weather monitoring system using Arduino is the simplest arduino project which can help us to monitoring the temperature and humidity by using one sensor. there we are using the DHT11 sensor which is easily capable to measure the temperature and humidity , MQT2 sensor for measuring the air quaility , LDR sensor for luminance detection.
